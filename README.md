# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The app uses AJAX for database calls to MongoDB and jquery for scripting purposes. It also runs on an express server.

The app has all of the basic functionalities outlined in the project description, but also allows for pressing enter to submit a tweet and is slightly optimized for mobile viewing by removing the margins on mobile devices.

## WIP

Currently working on user registration and login in a separate branch.
